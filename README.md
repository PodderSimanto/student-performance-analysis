#  Student Performance Analysis & Prediction

This project focuses on analysing student exam performance and predicting whether a student will pass or fail using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about 1000 students, including gender, lunch type, test preparation, and scores in math, reading, and writing.

##  Objective
- Analyse the relationship between student features and academic success
- Build ML models to predict whether a student will pass or fail
- Evaluate and compare model performance

## Dataset
- `StudentsPerformance.csv`
- 1000 student records
- Features:
  - Gender
  - Lunch type
  - Test preparation course
  - Math score
  - Reading score
  - Writing score

##  Steps Involved
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building (Logistic Regression, Random Forest)
5. Evaluation using Accuracy, F1-score, and Confusion Matrix

## Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression (96% accuracy)
- Random Forest Classifier (99% accuracy)

## Results
- Reading and writing scores are the most important features
- Students with standard lunch and completed test prep performed better
- Random Forest outperformed Logistic Regression

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“š What I Learned
- Data preprocessing and visualisation
- Building and evaluating ML models
- Feature importance analysis
- Understanding classification metrics

## ðŸ’¡ Future Work
- Add more features (e.g., parental education, study time)
- Deploy as a web app using Streamlit
- Try advanced models like XGBoost
